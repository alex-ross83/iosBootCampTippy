# Pre-work - Tippy

Tippy is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Ross Lopez

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1**: "What are your reactions to the iOS app development platform so far? How would you describe outlets and actions to another developer? Bonus: any idea how they are being implemented under the hood? (It might give you some ideas if you right-click on the Storyboard and click Open As->Source Code")

**Answer:** I see them as wiring events to code that needs to be executed. Every action can be mapped to a corresponding view in the StoryBoard that should reflect what the user is trying to achieve.

Question 2: "Swift uses [Automatic Reference Counting](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH20-ID49) (ARC), which is not a garbage collector, to manage memory. Can you explain how you can get a strong reference cycle for closures? (There's a section explaining this concept in the link, how would you summarize as simply as possible?)"

**Answer:** The problem arises because the closure, which basically works as a reference type, has to capture the caller, self, depending on the code written in it. It can cause the both get strongly referenced and hence, never deallocated. The fix for this, as explained in the Apple Developer Documentation, is to define which dependencies will the closure have, and what relationships they should maintain to the closure, i.e.:

```
lazy var someClosure: (Int, String) -> String = {
    [unowned self, weak delegate = self.delegate!] (index: Int, stringToProcess: String) -> String in
    // closure body goes here
}
```
The previous snippet defines that the closure will use the object self, but predefines that this association should be a weak reference, allowing to be deallocated when no longer in use.
